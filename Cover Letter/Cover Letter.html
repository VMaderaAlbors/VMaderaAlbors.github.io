                <p>Throughout my career, I have contributed to positive business results through effective organisation,
                    prioritisation and follow-through of key organisational projects. My strengths and qualifications
                    are ideal for any job requirements and will bring immediate value to the company.
                    As an ambitious and hard-working student, I know that I can make a positive impact and achieve any
                    goals. My record of academic achievement and peer-group contribution supports a high level of
                    dedication.
                    In my former assistant Manager role, I exercised a calculated and methodical approach to
                    problem-solving. While I am independently motivated, I appreciate collective efforts and collaborate
                    productively within group settings. Moreover, I am competent in leadership and communication, with
                    proficiency in analytical thinking. My professional goals are aligned towards technological
                    development. Furthermore, my JavaScript, Java and Database knowledge/abilities will serve to support
                    any organisational efforts.
